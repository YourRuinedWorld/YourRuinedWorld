There are beautiful things in this world. This is what the dreadful group called "Wonderful World" tells themselves. 
This world is far from beautiful. As we've seen countless times again, people who are ignorant and oblivious to the problems 
going on in the world suffer the most from the systems that harm us without even realizing it. Besides, the whole point of art 
is to share an idea and more often than not that idea criticizes the world just as we do. If you don't like that we spread 
our ideas through writing instead of art that's fine, but going out of your way to defame us by saying that we're all negative 
while you guys just sit there looking at pretty things while you do nothing? We're going to have to say no to that. If anyone 
could figure out the name of the person who runs this site, that would be great.
