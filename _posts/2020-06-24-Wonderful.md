There are beautiful things in this world. This is what the dreadful group called "Wonderful World" tells themselves. This world is far from beautiful. As we've seen countless times, people who are ignorant and oblivious to the problems going on suffer and allow others to suffer because of it. Besides, the whole point of art is to share an idea and more often than not that idea criticizes the world just as we do. If you don't like that we spread our ideas through writing instead of art that's fine, but will we allow you to continue going out of your way to defame us by saying that we're all negative while you guys just sit there looking at pretty things while you do nothing? We're going to have to say no. If anyone could figure out the name of the person who runs this site, that would be great.
