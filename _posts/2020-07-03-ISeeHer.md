I see her. She's down the corridor. She keeps trying to get me to go with her. I've said no countless times because I thought she was gone, but I'm starting to question if she really died. I never checked her pulse. I just saw her body. After her death I wondered if she could still be alive and now, proof stands right before me.  

I've seen her so many times that this couldn't be a one-off vision. She's real. She's alive. And I'm going to trust that she knows where to go.
