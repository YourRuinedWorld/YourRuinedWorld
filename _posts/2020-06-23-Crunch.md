The games industry is known for churning out content every year, some better than others of course, and increasing the graphics quality of their games each time. However, there is a dark side to this. As games companies are expected to release content fast, their employees need to work extremely quickly to keep up with release schedules. This has resulted in a common industry practice known as crunch. Crunch happens when games companies force some of their employees to work up to 100 hours a week, some even boasting about it in marketing for their games! It was first brought to the world's attention my an anonymous blog post from a spouse of someone working in the games industry, and it described how her husband had been coming home very late at night with with constant headaches and a chronically upset stomach. According to her, his job at EA was ruining his life! It hasn't stopped either, as most recently crunch has been spotting at it's worse during the development of Fortnite by Epic Games and the development of Red Dead Redemption 2 by Rockstar.   

It's a catastrophe that people in the games industry have to go through this, though it can be remedied by creating unions of games workers to prevent crunch. During my research I couldn't figure out what the name of the spouse who wrote the original letter was. Maybe someone can find it for me?
