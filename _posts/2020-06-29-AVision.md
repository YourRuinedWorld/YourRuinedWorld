I've been inside TISA for a few days now. I'm just making my way between coldspots whenever I think ANGEL is offline.  

I keep having visions. Hallucinations maybe? I keep seeing Stacy standing there, sometimes walking or trying to lead me somewhere. But each time she walks somewhere that would get me caught. I don't know what's making it happen, but I keep having to take breaks because seeing her is too much.  

Then, in my dream last night, I saw her again. She walked towards me to give me a kiss, but as her face neared mine her skin dried and crumbled and her muscles melted like plastic and her bones all crumbled to the ground and instead of Stacy in front of me I saw this dragon with 4 wings staring at me and grinning. I can't handle this anymore. I went back to the 1st floor so I could get connection, since I thought you guys should know about this.
